# Canvas React App
This is a simple React app that uses the react-color and react-konva libraries to create a canvas element with a color picker and a 2-digit overlay element that can be dynamically changed. The canvas can be resized in both the x and y axes, and hovering over the 2-digit element displays a zoomed-in view.
